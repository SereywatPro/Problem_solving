1. Sum of Two Numbers
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.
Purpose: Practice input/output and basic arithmetic.
2. Even or Odd
Write a program to check if a given number is even or odd.
Purpose: Learn about conditionals (if-else statements).
3. Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Write a program to input three numbers and print the largest one.
Purpose: Practice logical comparison and nested conditionals.
4. Reverse a String
Write a program to take a string as input and print it reversed.
Purpose: Work with strings and loops or slicing.
5. FizzBuzz
Print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; for multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz."
Purpose: Practice loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic.
6. Factorial of a Number
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
Purpose: Introduce recursion or loop-based solutions.
7. Check for Palindrome
Write a program to check if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Purpose: Combine string manipulation and logical conditions.
8. Count Vowels in a String
Write a program to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
Purpose: Learn about loops and character matching.
9. Find the Second Largest Number in a List
Write a program to find the second largest number in a list of integers.
Purpose: Work with arrays/lists and sorting logic.
10. Generate Fibonacci Sequence
Write a program to generate the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
